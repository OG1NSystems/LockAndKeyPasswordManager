A WPF Password Application that uses a SQLite DB

My better half was always getting on at me for not writing down logins and passwords incase she needed them, and of course I wouldn't for obivious reasons. I personally am not a fan of more traditional free Password Managers, such as KeePass, due to their UI, so I decided to create my own.

I am using a WPF UI with a .NET 6 backend and a SQLite database for storage.

Enjoy!
